## Sentence structure


## Explain with a colon -> :

Let's say you're writing something technical and need some extra words to explain the subject. You can use the colon to add extra words about a subject without affecting the structure of the sentence.


"The function accepts a list and an item to find. It then searches the list in O(n) time: it takes time proportional to the number of items in the list."


This is a quick and easy way to clarify something that you're writing about without ruining the original sentence that you were writing.
